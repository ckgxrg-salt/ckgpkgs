# ckgpkgs
Well now I think it's better to put everything in one repo so I don't have to use `nix flake update` each time.
Everything is back to my main dotfiles repo, archiving this.

```
Just a collection of packages that are not included in the official nixpkgs.  
There are also some modules I use to simplify my configuraion.  

Didn't choose to fork nixpkgs because it's bit of heavy and I just want some simple packages.
